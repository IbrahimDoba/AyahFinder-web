Keep up with the imam using technology that follows along for you.

Taraweeh prayer is beautiful. Twenty rakats of standing in prayer, listening to the melodious recitation of the Quran. But let us be honest: it can also be challenging. The imam recites quickly. The surahs are long. By the time you find the verse in your mushaf or app, he has moved on to the next one. For converts and non Arabic speakers, this challenge is even greater. You want to follow along, to read the translation, to understand what is being recited. But the speed makes it impossible. This is where real time ayah tracking comes in. Technology that follows the imam so you do not have to scramble.
