Not all Quran apps are created equal. Here is what sets AyahFinder apart from the rest.

I have tried them all. The apps with beautiful Arabic fonts. The ones with 50 translations. The ones that let you bookmark your favorite verses. They are all great at what they do. But here is the thing: traditional Quran apps assume you already know what you are looking for. They are like a library catalog that requires you to know the book title before you can find it. AyahFinder flips this model on its head. Instead of searching by text, you search by sound. It is the difference between a dictionary and a translator. Between a map and a GPS. Let me break down exactly how we are different.
