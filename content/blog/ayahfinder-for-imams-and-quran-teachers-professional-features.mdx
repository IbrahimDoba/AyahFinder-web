How religious leaders are using AyahFinder to enhance their teaching.

Sheikh Ahmad runs a Quran school in London with 200 students. Last Ramadan, he started using AyahFinder in his classes. Not to identify recitations, he already knows every surah by heart. He uses it to help his students connect what they hear with what they read. To bridge the gap between listening and literacy. To make the Quran accessible to converts who are still learning Arabic. I sat down with Sheikh Ahmad and several other imams and teachers to understand how they are using AyahFinder professionally. Their insights changed how I think about our own app.
