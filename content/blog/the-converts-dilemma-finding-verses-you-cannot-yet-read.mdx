Special solutions for new Muslims navigating Arabic script.

Converting to Islam is a beautiful journey. But it comes with challenges. One of the biggest is accessing the Quran when you cannot yet read Arabic. You hear recitation at the mosque, feel its power, but have no way to connect it to meaning. Transliterated mushafs help, but finding verses is still difficult. You are essentially learning two things at once: the sounds of Arabic and the script of Arabic. This double learning curve makes traditional Quran apps frustrating. You need a bridge. A way to go from sound to meaning without needing to read Arabic first.
