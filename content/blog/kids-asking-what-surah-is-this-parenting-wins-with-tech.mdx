How to answer your children's Quran questions with confidence.

My seven year old asked me a question I could not answer. Baba, what surah is this? We were in the car, Quran playing on the radio. I recognized the reciter but not the surah. I made a guess, said Al Baqarah, and hoped for the best. Later I found out it was actually Surah Al Imran. My son believed me. I had accidentally taught him the wrong information. That moment made me realize I needed a better way. Not just for me, but for my children. A way to answer their Quran questions accurately every single time.
