Your Quran journey is private. Here is how we keep it that way.

In an age where every app seems to be selling your data, I want to be completely transparent about how AyahFinder handles your information. We do not sell your data. We do not track your location. We do not build profiles about your religious practices. When you use AyahFinder to identify a Quran recitation, that audio is processed securely and never stored permanently. Your recognition history stays on your device unless you explicitly choose to back it up. This is not just policy. It is a commitment to protecting the privacy of Muslims worldwide.
