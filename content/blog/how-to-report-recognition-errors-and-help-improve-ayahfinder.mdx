AyahFinder gets better because of users like you. Every time you report a recognition that failed or returned incorrect results, you help us improve the app for millions of Muslims worldwide. This is not just about getting your specific issue fixed - it is about contributing to a tool that serves the Ummah. Here is how to report errors effectively and become part of AyahFinder's continuous improvement.

## What to Report

Report any recognition that fails when it should succeed. If you know the surah being recited but AyahFinder cannot identify it or identifies it incorrectly, that is valuable data. Also report if the app is unusually slow, if the interface behaves strangely, or if offline mode stops working. Even small glitches matter - what seems minor to you might indicate a larger issue we need to address.

## How to Submit a Report

Open AyahFinder and go to Settings, then 'Report an Issue.' Describe what happened clearly. What were you trying to identify? What result did you get instead? When did this happen? The more detail, the better. If possible, include a screenshot or short recording of the problematic recitation. There is also an option to send diagnostic data from your device, which helps our engineers understand technical details. All reports are reviewed by our team.

## The Information That Helps Most

The most useful reports include: the specific surah and ayah that was being recited, who the reciter was (if known), what environment you were in (quiet room, noisy mosque, etc.), what result AyahFinder gave (failed, wrong surah, etc.), and your device type and app version. This information lets us reproduce the issue in our testing lab and develop fixes. Vague reports like 'it does not work' are hard to act on.

## What Happens After You Report

Every report enters our tracking system. We categorize issues by severity and frequency. If multiple users report the same problem, it gets priority. Our engineers investigate, develop fixes, and test them thoroughly. Fixes are released in app updates. You might not see immediate results - some fixes take weeks or months to implement properly - but your report contributes to the improvement. We read every single submission.

## Being Part of the Community

Reporting errors makes you part of the AyahFinder community. You are not just a user; you are a contributor to a tool that helps Muslims worldwide connect with the Quran. Consider joining our beta testing program if you want even more involvement. Beta testers get early access to new features and help us catch issues before public release. Your participation, whether through occasional error reports or dedicated beta testing, earns you the gratitude of millions of users.


## TL;DR: Quick Summary

Report recognition errors through Settings > Report an Issue. Include specific details about what happened, the environment, and the recitation. Your reports help improve AyahFinder for millions of users worldwide.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Major fixes are announced in app update notes. For specific issues, we notify reporters if they included contact information.
