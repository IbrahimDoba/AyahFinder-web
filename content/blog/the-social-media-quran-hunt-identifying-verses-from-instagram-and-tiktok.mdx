How to find that beautiful Quran video you saw online.

You are scrolling through Instagram when a Quran recitation video stops you in your tracks. The visuals are stunning. The recitation is moving. But the caption just says beautiful Quran with no surah name. You want to find this verse, to add it to your collection, to understand its meaning. But how? Social media platforms are terrible at Quran attribution. Most reposts strip away the original context. The video might have millions of views and zero information about what is being recited. This is a daily frustration for Muslims online.
