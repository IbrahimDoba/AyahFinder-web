Your memory of the tune is enough. Here is how to find the verse.

There is a surah that has been stuck in my head for three days. I do not know the words. I cannot even hum it properly. But I remember how the reciter's voice went up at a certain point, how there was a pause, then a continuation. This happens to Muslims all the time. We remember the feeling of a verse more than the words themselves. Traditional search methods fail here. You cannot Google a melody. But AyahFinder can work with partial memories. If you can produce any version of the recitation, even humming, the AI can often identify it. Here is the technique that works.
