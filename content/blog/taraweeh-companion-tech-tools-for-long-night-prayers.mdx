How to stay engaged during extended taraweeh recitations.

Twenty rakats. That is the taraweeh prayer. Standing for over an hour, listening to the melodious recitation of the Quran. For those who understand Arabic, it is a spiritual journey. For the rest of us, it can be challenging. The mind wanders. The legs tire. We want to be present, to connect, to benefit. But without understanding, the connection is limited. This is where technology can help. Not as a distraction, but as a bridge. A way to follow along, to understand, to stay engaged from the first rakat to the last.
