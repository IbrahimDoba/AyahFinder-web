How a frustrating Ramadan moment led to an app used by millions.

It was the 15th night of Ramadan 2022. I was at taraweeh prayer at my local mosque, and the imam was reciting a surah that touched my soul. I wanted to read those verses again, to understand their meaning, to memorize them. But I had no idea which surah it was. I asked three people after prayer. None of them knew either. I went home frustrated and started searching online. Shazam did not work. Google was no help. That night, I realized millions of Muslims face this same problem every day. Three months later, the first version of AyahFinder was born.
