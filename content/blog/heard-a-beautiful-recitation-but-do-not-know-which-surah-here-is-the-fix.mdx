That frustrating moment when you want to find a verse but have no starting point.

You are at a friend's house for iftar. The Quran is playing softly in the background, and suddenly a verse catches your attention. The reciter's voice rises and falls with such beauty that your heart feels like it is being squeezed. You want to know which surah this is. You want to read it, understand it, maybe even memorize it. But asking in the middle of the gathering feels awkward. By the time you get home, the moment has passed. I have been there dozens of times. Before AyahFinder, I would try to remember a few words and search Google later. It rarely worked. Now, I just open the app, tap listen, and within seconds I have the answer.
