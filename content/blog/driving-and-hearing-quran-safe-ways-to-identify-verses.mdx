Road safety first. Here is how to identify verses without distraction.

The commute is one of the most common times Muslims listen to Quran. It transforms dead time into ibadah. But it also creates a dilemma. You hear a verse that touches your heart, but you are driving on the highway. You cannot look at your phone. You cannot search for the verse. By the time you reach your destination, the moment has passed. Safety must always come first. No verse is worth an accident. But there are ways to capture these moments safely. Ways that respect both your spiritual needs and your responsibility to other drivers.
