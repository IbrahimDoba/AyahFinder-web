Using technology to enhance focus and presence in prayer.

Khushoo. That state of complete presence, humility, and focus during prayer. It is what transforms physical movements into spiritual connection. Every Muslim seeks it, yet it eludes us so often. Our minds wander. We think about work, about problems, about what comes next. Technology is often blamed for destroying khushoo, and rightly so. Endless notifications and distractions pull us away from the present moment. But what if technology could also help? What if the right tools, used at the right times, could actually deepen our focus and connection?
