## Day 1: Setup and First Recognition

Start simple. Download AyahFinder from your app store and open it. Grant microphone permissions when prompted - without this, the app cannot hear recitations. Do not worry about privacy; your recordings are processed locally and never stored on our servers. Now find a Quran recitation video on YouTube or ask a friend to recite something. Tap the big green button, hold for 3 seconds, and watch the magic happen. That first successful recognition is your gateway to a new relationship with the Quran.

## Day 2: Explore Your Results

Yesterday you identified your first verse. Today, dive deeper into what AyahFinder showed you. Tap on that result and explore the options. Read the translation if you do not understand Arabic. Check which surah it came from and its context. Bookmark it if it resonated with you. Understanding what you can do with each recognition helps you see AyahFinder as more than just an identifier - it is a study companion.

## Day 3: Try Different Scenarios

AyahFinder works in various situations, so test them. Try it with different reciters - Mishary Alafasy, Abdul Basit, modern reciters. See how it handles their different styles. Try it with some background noise. Try it closer and farther from the speaker. Understanding these limits helps you use the app more effectively in real-world situations.

## Day 4: Build Your First Playlist

Today, create a collection. As you identify verses throughout the day, add them to a playlist. Call it 'My Favorites' or 'Verses for Peace' or whatever resonates with you. This playlist becomes your personal Quran collection, curated from moments that moved you. Having this organized collection transforms random discoveries into a structured resource you return to regularly.

## Days 5-7: Daily Integration

By now, AyahFinder should feel natural. Use it daily this week. When you hear Quran at the mosque, identify the surah. When a video has a beautiful recitation, capture it. When you are curious about what someone is listening to, find out. Make it a habit to check your recognition history each evening. This weekly review helps you see patterns in what moves you spiritually.


## TL;DR: Quick Summary

Your first week with AyahFinder should focus on exploration and habit-building. Start with simple recognitions, explore the features, test different scenarios, build playlists, and integrate it into your daily routine. By day seven, it should feel like a natural companion.
