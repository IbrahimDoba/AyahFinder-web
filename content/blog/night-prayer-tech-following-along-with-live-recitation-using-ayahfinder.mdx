Technology that enhances your tahajjud and qiyam experience.

The last third of the night is special. The Prophet (PBUH) told us that Allah descends to the lowest heaven during this time, asking who is calling upon Him. Tahajjud prayer is the prayer of the righteous, the secret worship of those who seek closeness to their Lord. Many of us want to establish this beautiful habit, especially during Ramadan. But there is a challenge: following along with long recitations when you are half awake, in the dark, trying to focus. Technology can help. Not replace the spiritual experience, but enhance it. Remove friction so you can focus on what matters.
