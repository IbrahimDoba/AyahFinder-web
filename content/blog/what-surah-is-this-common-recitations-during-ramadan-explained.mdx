The verses you hear most often in Ramadan and how to identify them.

Ramadan has a soundtrack. Walk into any mosque during this blessed month, and you will hear the same surahs recited again and again. Not because imams are unoriginal, but because these surahs carry special significance for the month of fasting, prayer, and reflection. Surah Al Baqarah's verses about fasting. Surah Al Qadr's description of Laylatul Qadr. Surah Al Mulk, which the Prophet (PBUH) recommended reading every night. If you know these common Ramadan recitations, you will recognize them instantly when you hear them. And with AyahFinder, you can identify them even faster.
