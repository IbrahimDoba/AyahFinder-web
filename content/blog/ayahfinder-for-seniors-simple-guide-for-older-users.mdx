Technology should serve everyone, regardless of age. AyahFinder was designed with simplicity in mind, making it accessible even for those who did not grow up with smartphones. This guide is specifically for seniors and their families, explaining how to use AyahFinder without frustration. If you are a senior Muslim wanting to connect with the Quran through technology, this is for you.

## Getting Started: The Basics

First, do not worry about understanding everything at once. You only need to learn one button - the big green one in the center of the screen. That is it. Everything else is optional. Ask a family member to download AyahFinder for you and help you open it once. After that, using it is as simple as pressing that green button when you hear Quran recitation. The app does the hard work; you just listen.

## Large Text and Clear Interface

We know small text is frustrating. AyahFinder uses large, clear fonts throughout the app. Results display the surah name in both big Arabic text and English transliteration. If you have vision difficulties, your phone's built-in screen magnification works perfectly with AyahFinder. Go to your phone's accessibility settings and enable zoom or magnification - it works seamlessly with our app.

## Voice Feedback Option

For those who prefer listening to reading, enable voice feedback in settings. When AyahFinder identifies a surah, it can speak the name aloud. This means you do not need to read the screen at all. The app listens to the Quran, identifies it, and tells you what it is - all through audio. This feature makes AyahFinder truly accessible for users with any level of vision.

## Getting Help from Family

If you need help setting up AyahFinder, ask a grandchild or younger family member. Show them this article and ask them to help you with the initial download and one practice recognition. Most young people can set this up in under five minutes. Once it is set up, you can use it independently. Consider this a bonding opportunity - learning technology together strengthens family bonds.

## Why Seniors Love AyahFinder

Many senior Muslims tell us AyahFinder reconnects them with the Quran in ways they thought were lost. As eyesight fades, reading small Quran text becomes difficult. As memory changes, remembering which surah is which becomes harder. AyahFinder bridges these gaps. You can listen to any recitation, identify it instantly, and hear the meaning. Technology becomes a tool for spiritual connection, not a barrier.


## TL;DR: Quick Summary

AyahFinder is designed for simplicity. Seniors need only learn one button - the big green recognition button. Large text, voice feedback, and simple operation make it accessible for users of any age or technical background.

## Frequently Asked Questions
