How audio recognition accelerates Quran memorization.

Memorizing the Quran is one of the greatest achievements a Muslim can attain. But it is also one of the most challenging. The process requires repetition, review, and constant connection between what you hear and what you read. Traditional hifz methods rely on listening to teachers and repeating after them. This works, but it is limited by access to qualified teachers and scheduled sessions. What if you could have a hifz helper available 24/7? A tool that could identify any verse you hear, show you the text, and help you connect sound to script? This is where technology transforms memorization.
