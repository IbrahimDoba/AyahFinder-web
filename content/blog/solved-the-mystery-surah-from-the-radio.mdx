How to identify Quran playing on radio stations and podcasts.

Islamic radio stations are a blessing. They fill our commutes, our workdays, and our homes with the words of Allah. But they rarely tell you which surah is playing. You might hear a beautiful recitation, feel moved, and have no way to follow up. Some stations have websites that list their playlists, but most do not. And even when they do, finding the exact moment you heard something is nearly impossible. I used to change stations when Quran came on because I knew I would get frustrated not knowing what it was. Now I welcome those moments because I have the solution.
