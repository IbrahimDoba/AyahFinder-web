How to curate verses, tafsir, and reflections in one place.

Every Muslim should have a personal Quran library. Not necessarily physical books, though those are beautiful too. But a collection of verses that have touched your heart, explanations that have deepened your understanding, and reflections that have changed your perspective. In the digital age, this library lives on your phone. Accessible anywhere, searchable instantly, growing with you over time. Building this library is one of the most rewarding spiritual projects you can undertake. And it starts with a single verse.
