We tested every Quran recognition app on the market. Here is what we found.

Shazam changed how we discover music. Tap a button, and the app tells you what song is playing. Naturally, Muslims wondered: is there a Shazam for Quran? An app that can identify any recitation instantly? Over the past few years, several apps have claimed to offer exactly this. Some are good. Some are terrible. Some work only with specific reciters. Others claim capabilities they do not have. I spent two weeks testing every Quran recognition app I could find. I tested them with different reciters, different audio qualities, and different scenarios. The results were eye opening.
