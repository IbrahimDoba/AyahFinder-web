We tested AyahFinder against 50 different reciters. Here are the surprising results.

One of the most common questions we get is: will AyahFinder work with MY favorite reciter? With so many beautiful voices in the Quran recitation world, from the legendary Sheikh Sudais to rising stars like Fatih Seferagic, it is a fair question. I spent an entire weekend testing AyahFinder against reciters from different countries, different qira'at, and different eras. I tested classical reciters and modern ones. Fast reciters and slow ones. The results genuinely surprised me, and I think they will surprise you too.
