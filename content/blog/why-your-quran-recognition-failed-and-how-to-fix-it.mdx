It happens to everyone. You tap the recognize button, wait eagerly, and instead of a surah name you get 'Recognition Failed' or 'No Match Found.' Do not worry - this is normal and usually has a simple fix. Let us walk through the most common reasons AyahFinder fails to identify a recitation and exactly how to solve each one.

## Problem 1: Poor Audio Quality

The most common cause of failed recognition is simply that the microphone cannot hear clearly. This happens in loud environments, when the phone is too far from the speaker, or when something is blocking the microphone. The fix is straightforward: move closer to the audio source, check that your phone case is not covering the microphone hole, and minimize background noise when possible. If you are at a mosque, try different positions to find the acoustic sweet spot.

## Problem 2: Insufficient Audio Sample

AyahFinder needs about 3 seconds of clear audio to create an accurate fingerprint. If you release the button too quickly, the sample is too short. If you hold it too long in a changing audio environment, the sample gets muddled. The sweet spot is holding the button for a steady 3-second capture. Practice this timing - it quickly becomes second nature.

## Problem 3: Rare or Unique Recitation

Our database contains over 600,000 samples, but it cannot cover every single recitation ever recorded. Very rare reciters, extremely unique styles, or heavily modified audio (like with excessive reverb or effects) might not match anything in our database. If you encounter this, try finding a clearer version of the same recitation or ask the source for the surah information directly.

## Problem 4: Outdated Offline Database

If you are using offline mode and getting frequent failures, your downloaded database might be outdated. We regularly add new samples and improve the algorithm. Go to Settings, then Offline Mode, and check for updates. Downloading the latest database often solves recognition issues immediately.

## Problem 5: App Permissions

Sometimes the simplest explanation is the right one. If AyahFinder has lost microphone permissions, it cannot hear anything to identify. Check your phone settings, find AyahFinder in the apps list, and verify that microphone permission is granted. This can happen after phone updates or if you accidentally denied permissions. Re-enabling them restores full functionality instantly.


## TL;DR: Quick Summary

Recognition failures usually stem from: poor audio quality, insufficient sample length, rare recitations, outdated offline databases, or missing permissions. Each has a simple fix. With practice, you will learn to position your phone optimally and achieve consistent recognition.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How many times should I try before giving up?**

Try 2-3 times with slight adjustments to position or timing. If it still fails, the recitation might be outside our database coverage.

**Does failure mean something is wrong with my phone?**

Almost never. Recognition failures are almost always environmental (noise, distance) or content-related (rare recitation), not device problems.

**Can I report failed recognitions?**

Yes. Use the 'Report Missed Recognition' feature in the app menu. This helps us improve our database for future updates.
