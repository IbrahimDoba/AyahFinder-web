The complete guide to digital tools for the modern fasting Muslim.

In 2026, Muslims have access to technology that previous generations could only dream of. Apps that help us connect with the Quran. Apps that track our prayers. Apps that facilitate charity, community, and learning. But with so many options, choice paralysis sets in. Which apps are worth your time? Which ones actually deliver on their promises? I have tested dozens of Islamic apps over the years. Some are essential. Some are nice to have. Some are not worth the download. This guide cuts through the noise and presents the ultimate Ramadan app stack.
