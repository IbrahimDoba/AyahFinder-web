I used to have 47 voice memos labeled beautiful Quran find later. Here is my solution.

I need to confess something embarrassing. Before AyahFinder existed, my phone had a folder of voice memos with names like beautiful recitation 1, must find this surah, and quran from radio tuesday. There were 47 of them. Forty seven moments of spiritual connection that I captured but never followed up on. I would tell myself I would identify them later. I never did. The list just grew. Each memo represented a lost opportunity to connect with the Quran. When we built AyahFinder, I was solving my own problem. And based on the messages we receive, I was solving a problem for millions of Muslims worldwide.
