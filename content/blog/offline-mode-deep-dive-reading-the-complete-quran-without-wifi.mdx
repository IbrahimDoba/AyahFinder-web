## What happens when you need to identify Quran recitation but have no internet connection?

Picture this: you are on a flight to visit family. The person next to you is playing Quran through their headphones, loud enough that you can hear the beautiful recitation. Your heart immediately wants to follow along, to know which surah this is, to read the Arabic text and translation. But you are 35,000 feet in the air with no WiFi. This exact scenario happened to me last year during Ramadan. I was frustrated that I could not identify the recitation. That moment inspired our team to build a robust offline mode for AyahFinder. Today, I am going to show you exactly how it works and why it changes everything.
