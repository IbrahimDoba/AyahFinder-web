Technology that keeps pace with rapid Quran recitation.

Some imams recite fast. Not rushed, but flowing. The words pour out like a river, beautiful and overwhelming. For Arabic speakers, this is a joy. For the rest of us, it is a challenge. You want to follow along in your mushaf or app, but by the time you find the verse, the imam has moved three pages ahead. You end up just standing there, listening without understanding. This is especially hard during taraweeh when the goal is to complete the Quran. But what if technology could keep pace? What if you had a digital companion that never falls behind?
