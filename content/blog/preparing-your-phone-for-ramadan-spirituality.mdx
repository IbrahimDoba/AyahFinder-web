Digital decluttering and optimization for the holy month.

Your phone is either a tool for good or a source of distraction. There is no neutrality. As Ramadan approaches, it is worth asking: is my phone set up to support my spiritual goals? For most of us, the answer is no. Our phones are cluttered with apps that waste time. Notifications that pull attention away from dhikr. Home screens that prioritize entertainment over worship. The good news is that transformation is possible. With intentional changes, your phone can become a powerful aid for your Ramadan journey. Here is how to make it happen.

• The Phone as Spiritual Tool vs Distraction
