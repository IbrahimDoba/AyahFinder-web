## During Prayer: Absolute Respect

Never use your phone during actual prayer (salah). This includes while you are performing prayer and when the congregation is actively praying. Using a phone during prayer is disrespectful and invalidates the spiritual focus required. However, during taraweeh prayers between rakahs, when the Imam pauses, brief use is acceptable if done quietly and discreetly. The rule is simple: if people are actively praying, phones stay away.

## In the Mosque: Discretion Matters

Mosques are houses of Allah, and behavior there should reflect that status. Using AyahFinder in a mosque is fine, but do so quietly and without drawing attention. Do not hold your phone up high where it blocks others' views. Do not speak aloud when the app identifies a verse. Do not let notification sounds interrupt the atmosphere. Use silent mode, be discreet, and remember that others are there to worship, not watch you use technology.

## At Islamic Gatherings: Reading the Room

Weddings, funerals, religious lectures, and community iftars often feature Quran recitation. Whether to use AyahFinder depends on the formality of the event. At a casual family gathering, identifying a beautiful recitation is appropriate and might spark beneficial discussion. At a formal funeral, keep the phone away entirely. Consider whether using your phone would seem disrespectful to elders or distracting to others. When in doubt, wait until later.

## While Driving: Safety First

Using AyahFinder while driving requires the same judgment as any phone use. If you are actively driving, do not interact with the app. Set it up before you start moving, or use voice commands if your phone supports them. Better yet, have a passenger operate the app. The Quran commands us to protect life; endangering yourself or others through distracted driving violates this principle. No identification is worth an accident.

## The Intention Behind Usage

Finally, examine your intention. Are you using AyahFinder to deepen your connection with the Quran, or to show off technology? Are you capturing verses for later reflection, or for social media likes? The same action can be beneficial or problematic depending on intention. Use AyahFinder as a tool for spiritual growth, not as a distraction from the sacred moment or a way to demonstrate tech-savviness. Sincerity makes technology a servant of faith.


## TL;DR: Quick Summary

Use AyahFinder with discretion in mosques, never during active prayer, safely while driving, and with sincere intention. Technology should enhance, not distract from, the sacred nature of Quranic engagement.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is it okay to use during khutbah (Friday sermon)?**

No. The khutbah is part of the Jummah prayer. Phones should be away and silent during this time.

**Can children use AyahFinder in the mosque?**

Children learning to use the app should practice at home first. In mosques, they should follow the same discretion rules as adults.

**What if someone asks what I am doing with my phone?**

Explain politely that you are identifying the Quran recitation. This often leads to beneficial conversations about technology serving Islamic practice.
