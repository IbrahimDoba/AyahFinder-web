The behind the scenes story of collecting over 600,000 Quran recitation samples.

When we started building AyahFinder three years ago, we knew the technology was possible. Audio fingerprinting existed. Machine learning was mature. What we did not have was data. You cannot build a Quran recognition app without thousands of hours of Quran audio, properly labeled, properly organized, covering every surah, every ayah, every major reciter. So we set out to build the world's largest Quran audio database. The journey took us to mosques in Cairo, recording studios in Dubai, and archives in Mecca. Here is how we did it.

• Starting From Zero: The Data Challenge

• Partnering With Mosques and Reciters

• The Labeling Process: 50,000 Human Hours

• Quality Control and Verification

• What the Database Contains Today

## Starting From Zero: The Data Challenge

By combining artificial intelligence with deep Islamic knowledge, modern apps like AyahFinder provide tools that previous generations could only dream of. The ability to identify any Quran recitation instantly removes barriers between Muslims and Allah's words, creating opportunities for connection that were previously impossible.
