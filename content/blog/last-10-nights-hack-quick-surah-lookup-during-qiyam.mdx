Maximize the most blessed nights with instant Quran identification.

The last ten nights of Ramadan are unlike any other time. Laylatul Qadr, the Night of Decree, is hidden among them. Worship on this single night is better than a thousand months. Muslims around the world increase their prayers, their dua, their Quran recitation during these precious nights. At the mosque, imams recite longer, more beautiful surahs. You want to follow along, to understand, to connect. But the surahs are less familiar. The recitation is more complex. This is when quick lookup becomes essential. When every moment counts.
