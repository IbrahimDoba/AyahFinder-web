## Ramadan Context

Consider the typical scenario where this technology proves invaluable. You are at a gathering, perhaps an iftar during Ramadan, when beautiful Quran begins to play. In the past, you might have tried to remember a few words to search later, or asked others if they recognized the recitation.

Within seconds, you know exactly what you are hearing and can engage with it meaningfully.
