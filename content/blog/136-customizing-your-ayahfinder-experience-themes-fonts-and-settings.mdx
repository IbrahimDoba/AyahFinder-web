# Customizing Your AyahFinder Experience: Themes, Fonts, and Settings

<Tip>
  Personalize AyahFinder with custom themes, font sizes, and display preferences
</Tip>

We each experience the Quran differently, and our apps should reflect that individuality. AyahFinder recognizes that personalization goes beyond simple preferences, it is about creating an environment where you feel comfortable spending time with the words of Allah. From visual themes to typography choices, the customization options let you craft a space that feels truly yours.

## Visual Themes and Color Schemes

The theme selection in AyahFinder goes far beyond light and dark mode. The app offers nature-inspired themes including desert sand, ocean blue, and forest green, each evoking different aspects of Allah's creation mentioned throughout the Quran.

The dark mode deserves special mention for its thoughtful implementation. Unlike simple color inversion, AyahFinder's dark theme carefully adjusts contrast to reduce eye strain during nighttime reading. The Arabic text remains crisp and readable, with tajweed colors carefully preserved for proper pronunciation guidance.

Seasonal themes add timely variety to your experience. Ramadan themes create a special atmosphere during the blessed month, while Eid themes celebrate occasions of joy. These limited-time options keep the app feeling fresh while honoring the Islamic calendar's rhythm.

## Typography and Font Choices

Arabic font selection profoundly impacts readability. AyahFinder offers classical Kufic for those who appreciate traditional calligraphy, modern Naskh for clarity, and specialized Hafs fonts for those following that riwayah. Each font has been carefully optimized for screen display.

Size adjustments work independently for Arabic and translation text. This dual control accommodates users at different stages of their Arabic journey. Beginners might prefer larger Arabic for character recognition practice, while advanced readers could prioritize translation size for deeper understanding.

Line spacing and margin controls let you optimize for your reading style. Dense layouts fit more text on screen for quick scanning, while spacious arrangements support meditative, word-by-word contemplation. These micro-adjustments make surprising differences in reading comfort over extended sessions.

## Layout and Display Preferences

The arrangement of elements on screen significantly affects comprehension. AyahFinder offers multiple layout modes including traditional right-to-left Arabic focus, side-by-side comparison, and interlinear formats showing word-by-word breakdowns.

Navigation preferences determine how you move through content. Some users prefer swiping between verses, others like tap zones, and some favor scrollable continuous text. All options remain available, with your choice becoming the default interaction method.

The information density setting controls how much supplementary content appears. Minimal mode shows only Arabic text for pure recitation focus. Standard mode adds translation and basic tafsir. Scholar mode displays multiple translations, detailed explanations, and related verses for comprehensive study.

## Audio and Voice Preferences

Beyond visual customization, AyahFinder lets you personalize the audio experience. Default reciter selection ensures your preferred voice plays automatically. With over fifty world-class reciters available, finding one that resonates with your heart is essential.

Playback speed controls adapt to your listening goals. Slow speeds support memorization and tajweed practice. Normal speeds suit general listening. Faster speeds allow reviewing large portions quickly, useful for khatm completion goals.

Voice command preferences let you customize how you interact hands-free. Set custom wake phrases, choose confirmation sounds, and configure how the app responds to your voice. These options make AyahFinder feel like a personal assistant attuned to your specific needs.


## Frequently Asked Questions

**Will my customizations sync across devices?** Yes, all personalization settings sync automatically when you sign into your AyahFinder account. Your theme, fonts, and preferences follow you whether using phone, tablet, or web.

**Can I create multiple profiles with different settings?** Currently AyahFinder supports one set of preferences per account. However, the quick-switch feature lets you save preset configurations for different contexts, like study mode versus casual listening.

**Do font choices affect app performance?** Some decorative fonts may load slightly slower on older devices. If experiencing lag, try switching to the standard Naskh font which is optimized for performance across all supported devices.

## Summary

Personalizing AyahFinder creates an environment where Quran engagement feels natural and comfortable. Take time to explore the various options, finding combinations that support your specific needs. The best configuration is uniquely yours, reflecting how you best connect with the words of Allah.
