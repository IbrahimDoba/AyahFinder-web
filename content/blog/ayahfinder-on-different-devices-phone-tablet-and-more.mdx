## Smartphones: The Primary Experience

Your phone is where AyahFinder shines brightest. Always with you, always connected (usually), and perfectly sized for one-handed use. The phone version offers the complete feature set - recognition, history, playlists, offline mode, and settings. If you only use AyahFinder on one device, make it your primary smartphone. Ensure it is the device with the most storage if you plan to use offline mode extensively.

## Tablets: The Study Companion

Using AyahFinder on a tablet transforms the experience. The larger screen makes reading identified verses easier, especially if you have vision challenges or prefer larger text. The expanded display shows more information at once - the Arabic text, translation, and context all visible simultaneously. Tablets are perfect for home use when you want to study identified verses in depth. Consider a tablet mount near your listening area for convenience.

## Older Phones: The Backup Option

Got an old phone sitting in a drawer? It can become a dedicated AyahFinder device. Factory reset it, install only AyahFinder, and keep it in your prayer area or living room. This gives you a device always ready for recognition without draining your main phone's battery. It also serves as backup if your primary phone has issues. Just ensure the old phone has enough storage for the offline database if needed.

## Syncing Across Devices

AyahFinder works on multiple devices, but your history and playlists stay on each device separately unless you create an account. If you want your recognitions to sync between your phone and tablet, sign in with the same account on both. This ensures that a verse identified on your phone appears in your tablet's history. Without an account, each device maintains its own separate history. Choose the approach that fits your usage pattern.

## Optimizing Each Device

Different devices need different settings. On your phone, enable offline mode for recognition on the go. On your tablet, maximize text size for comfortable reading. On an older backup device, disable unnecessary features to preserve performance. Customize each installation to its purpose. Your phone might be for quick identifications, your tablet for study sessions, and your backup for home use - each configured optimally for its role.


## TL;DR: Quick Summary

AyahFinder works on smartphones, tablets, and even older backup devices. Each offers different advantages. Use your phone for portability, tablet for study, and consider an old phone as a dedicated home device. Sign in to sync across devices.
