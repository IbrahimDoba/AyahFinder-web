# How to Export Your AyahFinder Data: Backup and Transfer Guide

</Tip>

Your AyahFinder journey is precious. Every verse you have identified, every favorite you have saved, every setting you have customized represents time spent connecting with the Quran. Losing this data would be heartbreaking, which is why understanding how to export and backup your AyahFinder information is essential knowledge for every user.

## Why Data Export Matters

Think about the months or even years you have spent using AyahFinder. That recitation you identified during Ramadan last year. The beautiful verse you discovered at your cousin's wedding. Your carefully curated favorites list that you return to during difficult moments. This is not just data, it is a digital diary of your spiritual journey.

Data export capabilities serve multiple purposes. Perhaps you are upgrading to a new phone and want to preserve everything. Maybe you want to create a backup in case something happens to your device. Some users like to analyze their Quran engagement patterns over time. Whatever your reason, having control over your data is empowering and important.

## Understanding Export Options

AyahFinder provides several ways to export your data depending on what you need. The full backup option creates a comprehensive file containing your complete history, favorites, tags, notes, and settings. This is perfect when switching devices or creating a complete archive.

Selective export allows you to choose specific data types. Maybe you only want your favorites list, or perhaps just your notes on specific verses. This targeted approach creates smaller, more manageable files focused on exactly what matters to you.

The sharing export feature lets you send specific verses or collections to friends and family. Imagine creating a curated list of verses about patience and sharing it with someone going through a difficult time.

## Step-by-Step Export Process

Exporting your data is straightforward once you know where to look. Start by opening AyahFinder and navigating to the settings menu, typically found in your profile tab. Look for the data management or backup section.

Choose your export format based on your needs. JSON files preserve all metadata and are perfect for technical users or complete backups. CSV format works well for spreadsheet analysis or importing into other applications. PDF exports create beautiful, readable documents perfect for sharing or printing.

Select what you want to include. Do you want just favorites, or your complete recognition history? Would you like to include personal notes and tags? The choice is yours, giving you complete control over your exported data.

## Transferring to a New Device

Moving to a new phone should not mean starting over with your Quran journey. After creating your backup on the old device, install AyahFinder on your new phone and sign into the same account. Navigate to the import section and select your backup file.

The import process typically takes just a few minutes depending on how much data you have. Your favorites will reappear, your history will restore, and your settings will return to exactly how you had them. It is like nothing changed except the device in your hand.

For the smoothest transition, use the same login method on both devices. If you signed in with Google originally, use Google again. This ensures all cloud-synced data transfers seamlessly alongside your local backup.


## Frequently Asked Questions

Whether backing up precious memories or transferring to a new device, these features put you in control of your information.
