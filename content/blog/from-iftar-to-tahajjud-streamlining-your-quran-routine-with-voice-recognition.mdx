A complete daily workflow for Quran engagement during Ramadan.

Ramadan days have a rhythm. Suhoor before dawn. Fasting through the day. Iftar at sunset. Taraweeh at night. Perhaps tahajjud in the last third. Between these pillars, there are moments for Quran. But these moments are brief and precious. You do not want to spend them fumbling with apps, searching for verses, or trying to remember which surah you were reading. You want frictionless access to the Quran. A workflow so smooth that engaging with Allah's words becomes effortless. This is what voice recognition technology enables.
